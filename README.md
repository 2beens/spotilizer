Study **golang** through using **Spotify API**.

A small project which aims to help managing personal Spotify lists, but mostly to do what I love to do in my life and study **Go**.

Came to my mind that I could find this useful, because a lot of times it hapens that I screw up my lists (by removing a song from fav songs list), without ability to undo the operation. Sadly, Spotify Desktop Client App does not have undo for that operation.
